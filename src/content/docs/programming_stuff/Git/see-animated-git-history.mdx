i will be showing you how to manually compile and install [Gource](https://gource.io/) on [Antix Linux](https://antixlinux.com/)

## Setup Gource

<Steps>

1. ### Prepare

   Install Build Dependencies

   ```sh
   sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libpcre2-dev libfreetype6-dev libglew-dev libglm-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libpng-dev libtinyxml-dev
   ```

   Download Source Codebase from [Gource github](https://github.com/acaudwell/Gource)

   ```sh
   curl -L -o ~/Downloads/gource.tar.gz https://github.com/acaudwell/Gource/releases/download/gource-0.55/gource-0.55.tar.gz &&
   tar -xvf ~/Downloads/gource.tar.gz
   ```

2. ### Compile & Install

   ```sh
   cd ~/Downloads/gource-0.55/ &&
   ./configure &&
   make &&
   sudo make install
   ```

</Steps>

## Usage

just cd into a git repo and run the `gource` command

```sh
$: cd git-project
$: gource
```

## Common Error

if error occurs `failed to load resource '.../data/file.png'` while running the gource command, then you need to manually compile and install SDL2 as Suggested by this issue [failed to load resource '/usr/local/share/gource/file.png'](https://github.com/acaudwell/Gource/issues/43)

Just run this command

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential git cmake libsdl2-dev &&
git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image.git &&
cd SDL_image &&
git checkout SDL2 &&
mkdir build &&
cd build &&
cmake .. &&
make &&
sudo make install
```
