import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

So, you have to have a .desktop file with the name of the browser in either these 2 directories

- `~/.local/share/applications/`
- `/usr/share/applications/`

There are 3 commands that set default browser in diffrent ways (why didn't they made it a single Command?)

<Steps>

1. ## Set Default for most general Launches

   **Pupose** : controls which browser to Lauch when another app (Like Login with Google button in Zoom) calls the default browser

   ```sh
   xdg-settings set default-web-browser name_of_the_browser_file.desktop
   ```

2. ## Set Default for cli tools or Scripts

   Terminal tools or scripts that call the `x-www-browser` command

   ```sh
   sudo update-alternatives --config x-www-browser
   ```

   then it shows a list of Browsers to Choose from, enter the Serial number of the browser as shown in the list

3. ## Set default for Antix Specific things

   Icons like the `Web Browser Icon` that opens Deafult Web browser based on Antix's Configurations

   ```sh
   desktop-defaults-set browser name_of_the_browser_file.desktop
   ```

</Steps>
